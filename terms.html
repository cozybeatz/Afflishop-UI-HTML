        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          1a) Vendor/Affiliate benefits.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">

          experience the unparalleled advantages, convenience, and ease of the
          Afflishop’s comprehensive marketing, hosting, advertising, sales and

          <strong>Services:</strong> Afflishop may also offer other services
          (“services”), as described more fully herein and on the Afflishop
          website or vendor web pages (collectively, the “site”), some of which
          are optional and/or may require additional payment. Services may
          include, but are not limited to, advertisement services (including
          e.g. featured listings and market “bumps”), enhanced marketing
          services (e.g. split testing, tracking and reporting), enhanced
          product placement, and more. Afflishop reserves the right in its sole
          discretion to add, delete, change, suspend or discontinue providing
          the marketplace, services, and/or site to you at any time, and may
          impose limits on certain features and materials offered or restrict
          your access to parts or all of marketplace, services, and/or site
          without notice or liability. <br /><br />
          <strong>Other benefits:</strong> Afflishop may offer certain other
          benefits. As a vendor/affiliate you may have the opportunity to attend
          live events, conferences, seminars, technical workshops, and/or other
          events (including online or on-air broadcasts of such events, or
          recordings thereof) (“Afflishop events”). <br /><br />
          Afflishop events may be free or paid admission, open to the public or
          restricted to vendors/affiliates. Afflishop will endeavor, at its
          discretion, to provide discounted admissions, special sessions,
          opportunities to speak, or other options to vendors/affiliates. So,
          basically some of the Afflishop features, benefits and services are
          free, while others might require an extra fee, and Afflishop may
          offer, remove or change them at any time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">2. Using Afflishop</p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          You understand and agree that Afflishop and the Afflishop marketplace
          are private communities, and Afflishop reserves the right to provide
          service or refuse service to any buyer or user, or to accept or reject
          vendors/affiliates on any basis, in its sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">a. Becoming a User/Buyer</p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          Anyone may generally purchase products from Afflishop subject to these
          terms and conditions. Valid email addresses and phone numbers will be
          required for purchases. Afflishop reserves the right to refuse service
          to any person who, in Afflishop’s sole judgment, seeks refunds without
          justification or with a high frequency (“serial refunders”). Buyers
          who repeatedly or consistently seek refunds on many products
          purchased, particularly where those products have been reviewed and
          received good ratings may be deemed a serial refunder and refused
          further service. In addition, Afflishop provides a simple means of
          requesting refunds within the allowed money-back window for the
          purchased product. If a buyer refuses to follow Afflishop’s approved
          procedures and the agreed-upon refund period for refunds, Afflishop
          reserves the right to ban the buyer for life from future use of
          Afflishop or the Afflishop marketplace as a buyer, vendor or affiliate
          and such none compliance shall be treated as waiver. In the case where
          a particular product is not covered by the Afflishop 30-Day money back
          guarantee, Afflishop will notify the potential buyer by putting a
          message on the sales/order page of the product.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          b. Becoming a Vendor/Affiliate
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          You understand that Afflishop and the Afflishop marketplace are
          private communities, and Afflishop reserves the right to accept or
          reject vendors/affiliates on any basis, in its sole discretion. To be
          eligible to become a vendor/affiliate on the Afflishop marketplace,
          you must complete an application to register and pay the required
          registration/signup fees. We will require you provide us with details
          sufficient for Afflishop to determine if you qualify to be a
          vendor/affiliate, and if you are acceptable. To qualify, you must be
          at least 18 years old, and you must provide your real name and
          current/accurate and verifiable contact information. You must not have
          been banned or refused service from Afflishop previously or Afflishop
          reserves the right to reject your application.
          <br /><br />
          You understand and agree to provide only truthful information and to
          keep such information current at all times. If the information you
          provide to Afflishop is inaccurate, it may result in delays in
          processing your application, and could result in Afflishop not being
          able to pay you. If the information you provide is not truthful or
          cannot be verified, your application will be rejected. Afflishop has
          the right to refuse and/or cancel any new application or existing
          account for any reason in its sole discretion and for no reason. Where
          it is discovered that misleading or inaccurate information is
          provided, in addition to what this clause already provided, Afflishop
          shall not be liable for any action of the Vendor/affiliate and
          reserves the right to seek appropriate legal redress.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          Getting approved as an affiliate:
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          Prior to being able to earn a commission on any particular product,
          you must agree to these terms and conditions plus (in some cases), you
          must be accepted by the vendor before you can promote the product or
          earn any commission from your promotions so, basically you must fill
          in your Afflishop application and profile form with truthful and
          complete information and also pay the required registration fee to
          sign up as a vendor/affiliate on Afflishop, and Afflishop has the
          right to refuse and/or cancel any member account in its sole
          discretion any misinformation or inaccurate information shall be
          sufficient reason to deny you of any commission earned.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          3. Vendors: Selling your products
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          Content: As a vendor hereunder, you may submit one or more products
          for sale (“products”) via the Afflishop marketplace. The products may
          include any form of digital content (written, audio, video, etc.)
          (“Content”) as is appropriate for your products. All digital products
          and content must be suitable for digital delivery.
          <br /><br />
          Afflishop acts as a reseller for the vendors' products. That means
          that buyers are technically buying from Afflishop and not directly
          from the vendor. You will however retain all rights and liabilities to
          your products except as provided herein.
          <br /><br />
          You understand that Afflishop will review your products or content for
          completeness, accuracy, quality, marketability, or the like, so it's
          your responsibility as a vendor to submit products with complete,
          accurate and quality contents that match truthfully what's advertised
          in your sales page, or else Afflishop might remove them from the
          marketplace.
          <br /><br />
          Afflishop reserves the right to reject any product(s) for any reason
          or no reason at any time in its sole discretion. Moreover, it is to
          your great advantage to ensure the quality of your product(s). Each
          product will be subject to reviews and/or ratings from purchasers,
          which will be available and/or prominently displayed to potential
          buyers of your product(s) in the market place.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">(i) Allowed product(s):</p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          Afflishop does not allow, and you agree not to, submit any product(s)
          or content that are pornographic or offensive in nature, or which
          pertain to pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing (mlm) or any illegal
          activity, or which contains any illegal material including but not
          limited to material that violates another’s copyrights or trademarks,
          trade dress, trade secrets, right of publicity, privacy or other
          rights, including moral rights or rights of attribution. Afflishop
          shall use its unfettered discretion and expressly reserves the right
          to remove any such products, content or material from the marketplace,
          without notice and without compensation to you. You agree that any
          advertising or other fees paid in connection with products, content,
          or other material that is removed from the marketplace will not be
          refunded. You further agree that you remain fully responsible for any
          damages to Afflishop and to its customers that result from your
          submission to, or inclusion of such products, content, or material in
          the marketplace.
          <br /><br />
          To be included in the Afflishop marketplace, your products must be
          original. Private label rights (“plr”) that you have obtained cannot
          be the basis of a product. Plr material can be offered, for example,
          as a free bonus distributed alongside a product, but not as the
          product itself. Afflishop reserves the right to refuse to accept any
          product or to remove any product that it deems to lack sufficient
          originality. You must have all required rights, including copyrights
          to all content in your product(s) to allow Afflishop to sell the
          product. The foregoing requirement includes all content within the
          product(s), for example cover images, as well as any music, including
          background music in recorded audio or video products. In addition to
          the other licenses granted herein, you also grant Afflishop a limited
          license to resell your products, and process all payments in
          connection therewith. Afflishop shall pay you in accordance with the
          payment provisions herein. Where you fail to ensure compliance with
          any of the above the failure of Afflishop to request at the time of
          submission shall not limit your liability in anyway.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          (ii) Pricing of Product(s):
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          Vendors and only vendors may set the price (“sales price”) of their
          own products within the limits established by Afflishop for minimum
          and/or maximum prices (“price limits”). As a vendor, you agree not to
          attempt to price any product submitted to the marketplace outside of
          then current price limits in place at the time of submitting the
          product to the Afflishop marketplace. Afflishop will post its current
          price limits prominently on the site. Currently, the "lower price
          limit" is N5000 and the “upper price limit” is N800,000 for any
          product offered for sale in the marketplace. However, Afflishop
          expressly reserves the right to set the "upper price limit” for the
          marketplace as a whole, or on a per vendor basis. Vendors with
          marketplace track records of greater merit (including, e.g., lower
          refund rates, better purchaser reviews, higher ratings, longevity,
          etc.) may be afforded greater latitude in pricing their products, at
          Afflishop’s discretion. You understand that as a vendor, you are
          subject to the foregoing price limits unless you have been expressly
          notified in writing from Afflishop. Afflishop will review each
          petition for a price limit raise on a case by case basis, and may
          accept or decline the petition in its sole discretion.

          <br /><br />
          Notwithstanding the foregoing price limits, Afflishop also reserves
          the right to raise the upper price limit on a per product basis (i.e.
          for a particular product from a specific vendor) based on Afflishop’s
          direct review (“price review”) which may include consideration of the
          vendor’s history in the marketplace, reputation in the industry, the
          product itself, the proposed price, market conditions, current terms
          and relationships with payment processors, gateways, and such other
          factors as Afflishop chooses. After such price review, Afflishop’s
          decision as to whether to raise the upper price limit in any instance
          shall be final and made in its sole discretion. If Afflishop chooses
          not to raise the price limit for a given product, vendor agrees that
          the product shall be offered in the marketplace at a sales price below
          the upper price limit. Afflishop may charge a “review request fee” or
          may allow each vendor to request a set number of such price reviews at
          no cost, and may charge a review request fee for any additional price
          reviews requested by that vendor.

          <br /><br />
          As a vendor, you understand and agree not to offer the same product
          listed on the Afflishop marketplace for a different price somewhere
          else. This includes your website. In situations where the vendor has
          to alter the price of a particular product listed on the Afflishop
          marketplace on the vendor's website, the vendor must inform Afflishop
          to update the price on the Afflishop website as well.
          <br /><br />
          Afflishop reserves the right to suspend a Vendor's product if there
          are differences in price listed on the Vendor's website versus what is
          listed on Afflishop
          <br /><br />
          Afflishop may terminate any vendor who violates this provision
          repeatedly and the vendor shall be solely responsible for any
          liability that may result from such.

          <br /><br />
          The products must be original and the vendor must hold all required
          copyrights of the product(s) and content to allow Afflishop to sell
          the product(s). The product(s) must not relate to any of our forbidden
          niches (pornography, gambling, pyramid schemes, etc).

          4. Affiliates: Promoting products for a commission
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          As an affiliate in the Afflishop marketplace, you will have the
          opportunity to promote and make commissions on a wide variety of
          digital products offered via the state of the art Afflishop
          marketplace. As described above, products offered through the
          Afflishop marketplace are provided by our vendors for sale by
          Afflishop.
          <br /><br />
          You evaluate and choose which product(s) to promote:
          <br /><br />
          As an affiliate, you are solely responsible for evaluating and
          selecting the vendors and product(s) you would like to market or
          advertise. Afflishop endeavors to maintain the highest quality in the
          marketplace through its unique review system. Unlike other
          marketplaces where products are not reviewed and left to guess work.
          <br /><br />
          However, you should understand and agree that Afflishop is not
          responsible for the contents, accuracy, quality, usefulness, or any
          other aspects of any product, or any supplementary products.
          <br /><br />
          You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any costs
          associated with marketing, advertising, or mailing, including any
          marketing materials you choose to develop, regardless of whether your
          marketing or advertising efforts results in sales or not. Moreover,
          Afflishop does not provide any legal advice or review of your
          advertisements and you are solely responsible for the content of your
          marketing and advertising efforts and any liability resulting
          therefrom.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          Use only respectful promotion practices:
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          You agree that you will not use any marketing or advertising materials
          which contain any illegal material including but not limited to
          material that violates another’s copyrights or trademarks, trade
          dress, trade secrets, right of publicity, privacy or other rights,
          including moral rights or rights of attribution, or which are
          defamatory.

          <br /><br />

          Moreover, you agree that your advertisements and/or promotions will
          accurately represent the product(s), without hyping or exaggerating
          the contents, benefits or features. You must represent the product(s)
          in a truthful manner.

          <br /><br />

          You further agree that, in connection with products in the Afflishop
          marketplace, you will not use any marketing or advertising methods
          that include illegal methods including unsolicited email or sms, false
          or misleading advertisements or any advertisement which makes any
          claim that is not permitted about earnings or other aspects of a
          product, or other violates any law or regulation.

          <br /><br />

          You understand and agree that your marketing and advertising efforts
          shall not state or suggest that you are in fact Afflishop, or
          representing Afflishop or endorsed by Afflishop in any way or that you
          are the owner of the product as this will be treated as impersonation.
          Your marketing and advertising will not contain or utilize the
          Afflishop content (as defined herein) except as expressly permitted.

          <br /><br />

          You understand and agree that you will not personalize the vendor of
          the product you are promoting in any way through your marketing and
          advertising or suggest that you are the vendor. If you are found to
          mislead people by using the name(s) of the vendor as your own, it may
          result in Afflishop terminating your affiliate account and seizing any
          commissions you have in your affiliate balance without any warning
          whatsoever.

          <br /><br />
          Afflishop does not allow and you agree not to promote, market, or
          advertise any products or utilizing advertisements that are
          pornographic in nature, pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing (mlm)).
          You may not combine your advertising for products on the Afflishop
          marketplace with advertising for any such non-permitted products
          (including products not on the Afflishop marketplace).

          <br /><br />
          You agree not to state, or imply any guarantee or warranty about the
          product or a refund period other than what is expressly provided
          through the Afflishop marketplace. Marketing or advertising that
          provides, states, or implies any additional guarantee or warranty is
          expressly prohibited. Afflishop may terminate any affiliate who
          violates this provision and the affiliate shall be solely responsible
          for any liability that may result from such representation.

          <br /><br />
          You understand that Afflishop will use commercially reasonable efforts
          to track purchases so as to accurately account for affiliate
          commissions. Tracking codes, cookies, and/or similar technological
          means will be used where appropriate. When a potential purchaser views
          and/or responds to your advertisement, which includes your Afflishop
          affiliate information, any resulting sale will be credited to your
          account. Afflishop does not permit and you agree not to use any click
          jacking, cookie stuffing or other technological means of altering a
          Afflishop visitor’s cookies in any way to obtain commissions or credit
          for sales for which you would otherwise not be entitled. Afflishop
          reserves the right to determine who receives an affiliate commission
          for any particular sale. Afflishop also reserves the right to
          terminate, without notice, any affiliate who in Afflishop’ sole
          determination, has unacceptably manipulated the tracking of purchases
          or commissions.

          <br /><br />
          So, basically vendors (and Afflishop) can block affiliates with a
          large history of refunded transaction, low quality traffic, etc.
          moreover, you may have to apply in advance as an affiliate for some of
          the products you want to promote on Afflishop.

          <br /><br />
          It's your responsibility to select the right products to promote from
          our marketplace. Afflishop will do its best to ensure that the
          products on our platform are top notch but we do not offer any
          guarantee or representation in that regard.

          <br /><br />
          Use only respectful promotion practices (no spamming, no cookie
          stuffing, etc.), and don't exaggerate or hype the product beyond its
          truthful characteristics.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          5. Amount of commission to be paid on product sales
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          In exchange for their efforts in marketing and advertising products
          available in the Afflishop marketplace, affiliates will earn a
          commission determined as a percentage of the sales price of any
          product (“affiliate commission”) for sales resulting from those
          marketing and advertising efforts.

          <br /><br />
          A vendor can set the affiliate commission for any product(s) from 25%
          to 95%. Proceeds of the sales for each product shall be paid as
          follows: Afflishop fees shall be deducted from the gross sales price,
          and the affiliate commission shall also be based on the gross sales
          price as well. Any remaining balance after the Afflishop fees and
          affiliate commission are paid will be paid to the product vendor.

          <br /><br />
          Afflishop uses a secure tracking system to determine which affiliate
          referred the sale, and is entitled to a commission.

          <br /><br />
          So, basically affiliates are paid a commission for their promotion
          efforts. The vendor of the product determines the commission structure
          for that product.

          <br /><br />
          The proceeds that remain after paying the affiliate commissions and
          Afflishop fees are paid to the vendor.

          <br /><br />
          Afflishop uses a smart tracking system to track affiliate commissions.

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
          6. Secure vendor/affiliate access and communication
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          Upon registration as a vendor or affiliate, you will receive an
          Afflishop id and password to login as an Afflishop vendor/affiliate,
          from which you can access the vendor/affiliate resources (e.g. the
          ability to enter a new product, get affiliate links, check sales and
          other history). Except as otherwise agreed or permitted by Afflishop
          in writing, you may not share or transfer your id and secure password
          or access to the Afflishop system in any way or with any one. You are
          solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          Afflishop id and password and for any activity in connection with your
          account.

          <br /><br />
          It is also your responsibility to keep your phone number and primary
          email address up to date so that Afflishop can communicate with you
          via emails, phone calls and sms. You understand and agree that if
          Afflishop sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive
          it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of
          date, full, or your email is directed to a trash or spam filter, or
          you are otherwise unable to receive email or messages, the electronic
          communication will be deemed to have been provided to you.

          <br /><br />
          You can update your primary email address or other contact information
          at any time by logging into your Afflishop vendor dashboard. If your
          email address becomes invalid such that emails sent to you from
          Afflishop are returned, we may deem your account to be inactive and
          your status as a vendor/affiliate may be suspended or placed on hold
          until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.

          <br /><br />
          So, basically your login access is individual and private, and it's
          your responsibility to keep it that way. You may receive email or sms
          notifications from Afflishop.

        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          <strong>Contents of sales pages:</strong> The vendor is responsible
          for the content of the product sales page (“sales page”). You, the
          vendor, agree to provide all content to Afflishop in the permitted or
          required format(s) as determined by Afflishop and/or to upload such
          content in the permitted or required format(s) in your vendor
          dashboard. As a vendor, you have no direct access or rights to alter
          any sales page.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>Hosting:</strong>You understand and agree that the sales page
          ("sales page”) promoting the content and/or products on the
          marketplace will be hosted by Afflishop on Afflishop’s servers.

          <br /><br />
          Afflishop will make the sales pages in the marketplace available on
          the internet, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
          maintain the availability (i.e. uptime) of such sales pages for the
          consuming public. However, no guarantees of uptime are made. Afflishop
          does not own or control the internet and shall have no responsibility
          or liability for any time(s) the marketplace or specific sale pages
          are not accessible (i.e. “downtime”), even if your marketing and/or
          advertising efforts, product sales, or commissions are disrupted as a
          result of such downtime, and even if the downtime is a result of
          Afflishop’s error or negligence.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>Claims on sales pages or promotions: </strong>Whether you are
          acting as a vendor or affiliate for a product, Afflishop strictly
          prohibits any false or misleading claims in product(s), sales pages,
          or in advertisements including your sales copy or other marketing or
          advertising materials related to product(s) on the Afflishop
          marketplace, including any affiliate advertising materials.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>You may not and you agree not to: </strong>Make any
          unsupported, misleading, or false claim about any content or product,
          or results that it can produce.

          <br /><br />
          Include any false or misleading testimonial, endorsement, or implied
          endorsement. As a vendor, fail to disclose material connections
          between your endorsers of your product; or as an affiliate, fail to
          disclose material connections between any endorser of a product you
          are promoting and the product provider. You must also disclose if any
          reviewer or endorser of your product was compensated.

          <br /><br />
          Fail to include any disclaimer or statement(s) needed to qualify your
          claims, or to keep your advertising from being false or misleading.
          Make any suggestions or unsupported claims as to amounts of income or
          earnings that are typical or, that a purchaser will likely make, or
          should expect.

        <p class="text-gray-900 py-2">
          As a vendor, you agree that once placed in the Afflishop marketplace,
          sales of your product will be subject to a 30-day money-back guarantee
          from Afflishop.

          <br /><br />
          Consistent with Afflishop’s guarantee, purchasers are entitled to a
          30-day refund period or depending on the product vendor's desired
          configuration for that particular product.

          <br /><br />
          Buyers, affiliates and vendors with a high refund history may be
          banned from purchasing, selling or promoting products again from the
          marketplace.

          <br /><br />

          Afflishop may occasionally and at its sole discretion decide to grant
          a refund beyond the product money-back guarantee period.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>Payment processing and signup fees:</strong>To facilitate the
          marketplace, Afflishop will connect with other third part companies
          (including banks) to process all payments for all product purchases
          made through the Afflishop marketplace. Thus, you expressly grant
          permission to Afflishop to sell your products, and to process payments
          received from the sale of your product(s) in the marketplace, and
          agree to pay the assigned transaction or processing fees (“Afflishop
          fees”) in exchange for the services provided by Afflishop, currently,
          the Afflishop fees are as follows: <br /><br />

          <strong>For affiliates:</strong>All affiliates are required to
          register on Afflishop with N7000 ($10) This sum of N7000 is a yearly,
          non-refundable fee for affiliate maintenance paid to Afflishop.
          Afflishop has the rights to debit each affiliate of this sum once in a
          year. <br /><br />

          <strong>For vendors: </strong>All vendors are required to register on
          Afflishop with N14000 ($20) to start selling their products. This is a
          yearly, non-refundable fee. Afflishop has the rights to debit each
          vendor of this sum once in a year, plus Afflishop will also charge a
          commission of 8% per sale on all vendor products, these Afflishop fees
          can be changed at any time, and vendors and affiliates will be
          notified. <br /><br />
          <strong>Payments to vendors/affiliates: </strong>Except as provided
          below for first affiliate sale reserve, high-volume sales, or fraud
          investigation reserve, affiliates will be paid their commissions once
          in a week and vendors will be paid twice a month.

          <br /><br />

          Currently, affiliates and vendors can receive payments via any
          Nigerian bank account, and Afflishop is constantly working to offer
          new payment methods. Affiliates must have a minimum of N5000 in their
          Afflishop balance to qualify for a weekly payment.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>Afflishop right to hold back payments : </strong> Afflishop
          processes and pays out withdrawals weekly, specifically every Sunday.

          <br /><br />
          However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume
          spike or any specific transaction triggering our security filters,
          Afflishop reserves the right to hold credits beyond the standard
          Sunday payout period subject to Afflishop’s manual investigation of
          the account's recent activity. This generally will only take a few
          days, however Afflishop reserves the right to reasonably extend the
          reserve period for a time sufficient to resolve its questions about
          unusual activity to its own satisfaction.

          <br /><br />
          Afflishop endeavours to keep its reserves/holdback of processed
          payments as low as possible, and to generally release funds to
          vendors/affiliates within first Sunday after placing withdrawal from
          the sale.

          <br /><br />
          However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume
          spike or any specific transaction triggering our security filters,
          Afflishop reserves the right to hold the credits beyond the standard
          10-day period until a system administrator manually investigates the
          account's recent activity. This usually shouldn't take more than a few
          days.

          <br /><br />
          <strong>Fraud investigation reserve period: </strong> If Afflishop or
          one of Afflishop’s payment processors becomes aware of actual fraud,
          or suspected fraud in connection with any purchase or group of
          purchases related to your account, Afflishop reserves the right to
          require a fraud investigation. If such an investigation is required,
          any and all earnings/commissions earned on any basis may be
          temporarily held pending the investigation, whether or not connected
          to the actual or suspected fraud. Afflishop will use commercially
          reasonable efforts to have the fewest potential earnings/commissions
          held, based on its review of its risk. Such fraud may be in connection
          with debit cards, traffic, tracking, or some other basis.

          <br /><br />
          If a fraud investigation is initiated, the vendor/affiliate may be
          asked to provide additional information. You agree to cooperate with
          any such fraud investigation in a reasonable manner. You will be
          informed of the results of the investigation, and a full accounting
          will be provided regarding your account and any earnings/commissions
          due.

          <br /><br />
          Any vendor/affiliate that has actual or suspected fraudulent activity
          associated with one or more otherwise creditable or commission-earning
          sales should not assume that Afflishop suspects them of fraud. Stolen
          debit cards, fake debit cards, and other scams are prevalent on the
          internet and such activity may have nothing to do with the
          vendor/affiliate. Nonetheless, you understand and agree that you
          cannot be paid for an otherwise creditable or commission-earning sale,
          where Afflishop will not be paid. Moreover, Afflishop will comply with
          all legal requirements and will report all such activities to
          appropriate authorities. If a vendor/affiliate is believed to be
          directly or indirectly involved with fraudulent activity or attempted
          fraudulent activity in connection with the Afflishop marketplace,
          Afflishop will pursue all available legal action against the
          vendor/affiliate. In such circumstances, you agree that you will
          forfeit any balance in your account, and that Afflishop may use any
          such funds to partially or fully defray its costs of its investigation
          and any subsequent action, including legal fees and costs.

          <br /><br />
          Affiliates signup and maintenance fee: N7000/year subject to review.

          <br /><br />
          Vendors signup and maintenance fee: N14,000/year subject to review.

          <br /><br />
          Plus Afflishop will charge a commission of 8% per sale on all vendor
          products.

          <br /><br />
          Funds generated from vendor/affiliate will be released about 3 days
          after the refund period has expired. So, once those funds are indeed
          released, you will be paid.

          <br /><br />
          If there's any unusual activity detected on your account, or if our
          security filters are triggered, the reserve period may be increased
          while an administrator reviews the account's recent activity.
